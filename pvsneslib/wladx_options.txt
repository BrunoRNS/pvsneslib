2.136. .SNESHEADER
This begins the SNES header definition, and automatically defines .COMPUTESNESCHECKSUM. From here you may define any of the following:

ID "ABCD" - inserts a one to four letter string starting at $7FB2 (lorom) or $FFB2 (hirom).

NAME "Hello World!" - identical to a freestanding .NAME.

LOROM - identical to a freestanding .LOROM.

HIROM - identical to a freestanding .HIROM.

EXHIROM - identical to a freestanding .EXHIROM.

SLOWROM - identical to a freestanding .SLOWROM.

FASTROM - identical to a freestanding .FASTROM.

CARTRIDGETYPE $00 - Places the given 8-bit value in $7FD6 ($FFD6 in HiROM, $40FFD6 and $FFD6 in ExHiROM). Some possible values I’ve come across but cannot guarantee the accuracy of:

$00	ROM	 	 
$01	ROM	RAM	 
$02	ROM	SRAM	 
$03	ROM	 	DSP1
$04	ROM	RAM	DSP1
$05	ROM	SRAM	DSP1
$13	ROM	 	Super FX
ROMSIZE $09 - Places the given 8-bit value in $7FD7 ($FFD7 in HiROM, $40FFD7 and $FFD7 in ExHiROM). Possible values include (but may not be limited to):

$08	2 Megabits
$09	4 Megabits
$0A	8 Megabits
$0B	16 Megabits
$0C	32 Megabits
SRAMSIZE $01 - Places the given 2-bit value into $7FD8 ($FFD8 in HiROM, $40FFD8 and $FFD8 in ExHiROM). I believe these are the only possible values:

$00	0 kilobits
$01	16 kilobits
$02	32 kilobits
$03	64 kilobits
COUNTRY $00 - Places the given 8-bit value into $7FD9 ($FFD9 in HiROM, $40FFD9 and $FFD9 in ExHiROM). $00 is Japan and $01 is the United States, and there several more for other regions that I cannot recall off the top of my head.

LICENSEECODE $00 - Places the given 8-bit value into $7FDA ($FFDA in HiROM, $40FFDA and $FFDA in ExHiROM). You must find the legal values yourself as there are plenty of them. ;)

VERSION $01 - Places the given 8-bit value into $7FDB ($FFDB in HiROM, $40FFDB and $FFDB in ExHiROM). This is supposedly interpreted as version 1.byte, so a $01 here would be version 1.01.

This is not a compulsory directive.
