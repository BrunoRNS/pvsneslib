I'm not working on this fork anymore, so i'm archiving it, if want to see what I have implemented you can look into the pull requests of the original repository: https://github.com/alekmaul/pvsneslib or at the last commits of this repository. I'm thankful that I have collaborated in this project, thanks to Alekmaul and the contribuitors of this lib, without this I wouldn't be able to do the SNES-IDE, which is in ready-to-use version and open for improvements, check it out on: https://github.com/BrunoRNS/SNES-IDE, it is an automatizer for the pvsneslib library on Windows OS.
